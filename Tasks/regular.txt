Let’s create a variable called text1 and populate it with the value 	

Exercise 1
Create a variable called my_pattern and implement the required pattern for finding any digit in the variable text1.
Use function grepl to verify if there is a digit in the string variable

Exercise 2
Use function gregexpr to find all the positions in text1 where there is a digit.
Place the results in a variable called string_position.

Exercise 3
Create a variable called my_pattern and implement the required pattern for finding one digit and one uppercase alphanumeric character, in variable text1.

Use function regexpr to find the position of the first space in text1.
Place the results in a variable called first_space.

Exercise 5
Create a pattern that checks in text1 if there is a lowercase character, followed by any character and then by a digit.

Exercise 6
Find the starting position of the above string. Place the results in a variable called string_pos2.

Exercise 7
Find the following pattern: one space followed by two lowercase letters and one more space.
Use a function that returns the starting point of the found string and place its result in string_pos3.

Exercise 8
Using the sub function, replace the pattern found on the previous exercice by the string ” is not ”
Place the resulting string in text2 variable.

Exercise 9 
Find in text2 the following pattern: Four digits starting at the end of the string.
Use a function that returns the starting point of the found string and place its result in string_pos4.

Exercise 10
Using the substr function, and according to the position of the string found in the previous excercise, extract the first two digits found at the end of text2.
