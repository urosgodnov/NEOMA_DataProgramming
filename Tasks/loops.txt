Exercise 1
With, i <- 1, write a while() loop that prints the odd numbers from 1 through 7.

Exercise 2
Using the following variables:

msg <- c("Hello")
i <- 1

Write a while() loop that increments the variable, “i“, 6 times, and prints “msg” at every iteration.

Exercise 3
For this exercise, write a for() loop that prints the first four numbers of this sequence: x <- c(7, 4, 3, 8, 9, 25).

Exercise 4
For the next exercise, write a for() loop that prints all the letters in y <- c("q", "w", "e", "r", "z", "c").

Exercise 5
Write a nested loop, where the outer for() loop increments “a” 3 times, and the inner for() loop increments “b” 3 times. The break statement exits the inner for() loop after 2 incrementations. The nested loop prints the values of variables, “a” and “b“.

Exercise 6
Finally, write a for() loop that uses next to print all values except “3” in the following variable: i <- 1:5
